                        <p>Meet the Goux family! It all started when my parents met overseas in Holland. 
                            They were attending high school as both of their fathers were stationed at an Airforce Base. 
                            They were married right out of high school and along came my oldest brother Brock. He enjoys gaming and loves his cat. 
                            After 3 years my brother Ethan camong along. He is also in the United States Airforce. 
                            He enjoys handling his car detailing business, loves dogs, and enjoys anything outdoors and adventerous.
                            After 2 more years I was born. Being the youngest and the only girl has made me as strong and independent as I am today.
                            Our family enjoys exploring our home, Tennessee, and all the beauties it has to offer. We also love playing games and eating food.</p>

                        <p><img src="../images/mission.jpg" alt="Mission Photo" height="350px"></p>
                        <p>Growing up I never wanted to serve a mission for my church. It was a pretty common thing but I didn't think it was for me. 
                            After some spiritual experiences, some amazing people, and a deeper connection to God I knew it was something He needed me to do.
                            I was called to serve in the Scotland/Ireland Mission and as I waited for my visa I served in the Georgia Atlanta Mission. 
                            I left in Novemeber 2020 and spent 10 months in Georgia. My visa was processed and I left for Scotland. I arrived home Thanksgiving of 2021.
                            I learned many lesson during my time as a missionary teaching other people are Jesus Christ and his gospel. the biggest thing I learned was how merciful God is.
                            He isn't a scary, higher being waiting to punish us. Instead, He is a loving father in heaven who wants us to be happy, be safe, and succeed in life.
                            He is there to help us at any moment, we just need to ask.

                        <p><img src="../images/maggie.jpeg" alt="My Best Friend Maggie" height="400px"></p>
                           
                        <p>This is my best friend Maggie. We met in 2nd grade! She has been through a lot of 
                            challenges in her life but has come out stronger than anyone I know. Because of this I know I can turn to her for anything.
                            She never judges and is always ready to give me advice. One week she came to visit Utah. I was able to show her around town 
                            and do a lot of adventerous things with her. This is a picture of us at the Homestead Crater in Midway, UT.
                            It is a natural hotspring in the earth but even cooler, it is underground inside of a crater.</p>
